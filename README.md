In this project I have created an AI that will learn to get to the finish. It does that with help of a genetic algorithm I have programmed. Every new generation, I pick the 2 creatures who came the furthest, they will be the parents. Then I cross their genes and start creating children, by copying the parent genes and mutating them a little. This happens every generation, until one creature gets to the finish.
